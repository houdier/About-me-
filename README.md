## About gabrielecirulli/2048

gabrielecirulli/2048 is one of the repositories that I'm really interested in. 
It generally clones the game 1024, a very simple but interesting game. There are 16 numbers in the map, all of which are integral power of two. Users get 2048 by combining two identical adjacent numbers. It is written in javascript, which gives the users a better interactive experience.
